# FDA Update: LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) Subcutaneous Formulation

**Supplemental Approval Date:** June 2024
**Original Approval:** January 6, 2023
**Application Number:** BLA 761269
**Sponsors:** Eisai Inc. and Biogen Inc.
**Drug Class:** Amyloid Beta-Directed Antibody

## Background

LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) was originally approved in January 2023 as an intravenous infusion for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The FDA has now approved a subcutaneous formulation, offering patients an alternative administration option.

## New Subcutaneous Formulation

### Administration Details

**Dosing:** 
- 720 mg subcutaneous injection weekly
- Self-administered or caregiver-administered at home
- Comparable efficacy to 10 mg/kg IV biweekly dosing

**Injection Sites:**
- Abdomen, thigh, or upper arm
- Rotate injection sites with each dose
- Administered using pre-filled autoinjector or single-dose syringe

### Comparative Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | IV Formulation | SC Formulation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Dosing frequency | Every 2 weeks | Weekly |
| Dose | 10 mg/kg | 720 mg flat dose |
| Bioavailability | 100% (reference) | ~71% |
| Steady-state Cmax | Higher | Lower |
| Overall exposure (AUC) | Comparable | Comparable |

## Clinical Evidence: CLARITY AD Study

The original approval was based on CLARITY AD, a Phase 3 study in 1,795 participants with early Alzheimer's disease.

### Efficacy Results

**Primary Endpoint (CDR-SB at 18 months):**
- LEQEMBI: -0.45 points difference vs placebo
- 27% less decline than placebo (statistically significant, p<0.001)

**Secondary Endpoints:**
- ADCOMS (Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score): 24% less decline
- ADAS-Cog14: 26% less decline
- ADCS-MCI-ADL: 37% less decline

### Amyloid PET Results

- Mean amyloid reduction: -59 Centiloids at 18 months
- 68% of participants achieved amyloid-negative status

## Safety Comparison: IV vs Subcutaneous

### ARIA (Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities)

**ARIA-E (IV formulation - CLARITY AD):**
- Overall incidence: 12.6%
- Symptomatic: 2.8%
- APOE ε4 homozygotes: 32.6%
- APOE ε4 heterozygotes: 10.9%

**ARIA-E (SC formulation - preliminary data):**
- Incidence appears similar to IV formulation
- Ongoing monitoring in real-world use

### Injection Site Reactions (SC formulation)

- Local reactions: 8.4% of patients
- Most common: erythema, swelling, pruritus, pain
- Generally mild and transient
- Most resolve within 24-48 hours

### Infusion-Related Reactions (IV formulation)

- Occurred in 26% of patients
- Symptoms: flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, hypotension
- Generally mild to moderate

## MRI Monitoring Requirements

Both formulations require identical monitoring:

**Schedule:**
- Baseline MRI prior to initiating treatment
- Before 5th, 7th, and 14th doses
- Additional MRI if ARIA symptoms occur

**ARIA Management:**
- Asymptomatic ARIA-E: May continue treatment with enhanced monitoring
- Symptomatic ARIA-E: Hold treatment until symptoms resolve
- Severe ARIA: Discontinue permanently

## Comparison with KISUNLA (donanemab)

Both drugs target amyloid plaques but have key differences:

| Feature | LEQEMBI | KISUNLA |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Manufacturer | Eisai/Biogen | Eli Lilly |
| Target | Soluble protofibrils | Pyroglutamate amyloid |
| Administration | IV biweekly or SC weekly | IV monthly |
| Duration | Ongoing | Until clearance |
| ARIA-E rate | 12.6% | 24% |
| CDR-SB benefit | 27% | 36% |
| Cost/year | ~$26,500 | ~$32,000 total course |

## Real-World Implementation Challenges

### Access and Infrastructure

**Healthcare System Requirements:**
- Specialized infusion centers (for IV)
- MRI availability for monitoring
- APOE testing capacity
- Amyloid PET or CSF testing for diagnosis

**Patient Selection Criteria:**
- Early symptomatic Alzheimer's (MCI or mild dementia)
- Confirmed amyloid pathology
- No significant cerebrovascular disease
- Adequate caregiver support

### Insurance Coverage

**Medicare:**
- Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) initially
- Expanded coverage after full approval (July 2023)
- Requires participation in registry

**Commercial Insurance:**
- Variable coverage policies
- Prior authorization typically required
- Appeals process for denials

## Collaboration Details

LEQEMBI is jointly developed and commercialized by Eisai Inc. and Biogen Inc.:

- **Eisai:** Lead regulatory and commercial operations
- **Biogen:** Co-commercialization in US, manufacturing support
- Profit sharing arrangement: 50/50 in US market

Dr. Billy Dunn, Director of FDA's Office of Neuroscience, commented: "The subcutaneous option provides flexibility for patients and caregivers, potentially improving adherence to this chronic therapy."

## Post-Marketing Studies

Eisai is conducting:
1. **LEQEMBI-2 (AHEAD 3-45):** Prevention study in preclinical AD
2. **Real-world registry:** Safety and effectiveness monitoring
3. **Long-term extension studies:** Duration of benefit assessment
4. **Combination studies:** With other anti-amyloid therapies
