# FDA Approval: KISUNLA (donanemab-azbt) for Alzheimer's Disease

**Approval Date:** July 2, 2024
**Application Number:** BLA 761248
**Sponsor:** Eli Lilly and Company
**Drug Class:** Amyloid Beta-Directed Antibody

## Summary of Approval

The FDA has approved KISUNLA (donanemab-azbt) for the treatment of adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, which includes patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease, with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology. KISUNLA is the second amyloid-targeting therapy approved by the FDA, following LEQEMBI (lecanemab) approved in January 2023.

## Clinical Trial Data

### TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Trial

The approval was based on the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study enrolled 1,736 participants aged 60-85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.

**Primary Endpoint Results:**
- iADRS (integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale) showed 35% slowing of cognitive decline vs placebo at 76 weeks
- CDR-SB (Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes) showed 36% slowing of decline
- Participants with intermediate tau levels showed 40% slowing of decline

**Secondary Endpoints:**
- 39% of participants cleared amyloid plaques (below threshold of 24.1 Centiloids) and could discontinue treatment
- Time to progression to next disease stage delayed by 4.4 months in low/medium tau population

### Biomarker Outcomes

Amyloid PET imaging demonstrated significant plaque reduction:
- Mean reduction of 84 Centiloids from baseline at 76 weeks
- 52% of participants achieved amyloid negativity by 6 months
- 71% achieved amyloid negativity by 12 months

## Safety Profile

### Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA)

ARIA remains the primary safety concern for amyloid-targeting therapies:

**ARIA-E (Edema/Effusion):**
- Occurred in 24% of KISUNLA-treated patients vs 2.1% of placebo
- Most cases (78%) were asymptomatic and detected only on MRI
- Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 6% of patients
- Median time to onset: 3 months after treatment initiation

**ARIA-H (Hemorrhage/Hemosiderin):**
- Microhemorrhages: 31.4% KISUNLA vs 13.6% placebo
- Superficial siderosis: 13.6% KISUNLA vs 2.6% placebo

**APOE ε4 Genotype Risk:**
- ARIA-E rates by genotype: Homozygotes (45.5%), Heterozygotes (22.8%), Non-carriers (15.5%)
- APOE ε4 testing is recommended before initiating treatment

### Infusion-Related Reactions

- Occurred in approximately 8.5% of patients
- Most common symptoms: chills, flushing, rash, fever
- Generally mild to moderate in severity
- Premedication with antihistamines and acetaminophen recommended

## Dosing and Administration

KISUNLA is administered as an intravenous infusion every 4 weeks:

**Dosing Schedule:**
- Doses 1-3: 700 mg IV over 30 minutes
- Doses 4+: 1400 mg IV over 30 minutes
- Treatment duration: Until amyloid plaque clearance or lack of benefit

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Baseline MRI within 1 year before initiation
- MRI before 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th infusions (minimum)
- APOE ε4 genotype testing recommended

## Comparison with LEQEMBI

| Parameter | KISUNLA | LEQEMBI |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Manufacturer | Eli Lilly | Eisai/Biogen |
| Mechanism | Anti-amyloid | Anti-amyloid |
| Dosing | Monthly IV | Biweekly IV |
| Treatment duration | Until clearance | Ongoing |
| ARIA-E rate | 24% | 12.6% |
| CDR-SB benefit | 36% | 27% |

## Manufacturing and Distribution

KISUNLA is manufactured at Eli Lilly's facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana, with additional production capacity at their Kinsale, Ireland plant. The drug is distributed through specialty pharmacies with experience in administering monoclonal antibodies.

**Wholesale Acquisition Cost:** Approximately $32,000 for a full course of treatment (estimated 12 months average duration)

## Post-Marketing Requirements

Eli Lilly is required to conduct:
1. A study assessing the risk of ARIA in a broader population
2. Long-term safety surveillance program
3. Registry study for real-world effectiveness data
4. Assessment of optimal treatment duration criteria

## Related Approvals

This approval follows other recent Alzheimer's disease treatments:
- LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) - Eisai/Biogen - Approved January 2023
- ADUHELM (aducanumab) - Biogen - Approved June 2021 (limited availability)

Dr. Teresa Buracchio, Acting Director of the Office of Neuroscience at FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, stated: "This approval provides another treatment option for patients with early Alzheimer's disease and reinforces the amyloid hypothesis as a viable therapeutic target."
