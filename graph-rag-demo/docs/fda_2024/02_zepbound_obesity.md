# FDA Approval: ZEPBOUND (tirzepatide) for Chronic Weight Management

**Approval Date:** November 8, 2023 (Expanded Indication: March 2024)
**Application Number:** BLA 215866
**Sponsor:** Eli Lilly and Company
**Drug Class:** GIP/GLP-1 Receptor Agonist

## Summary of Approval

The FDA approved ZEPBOUND (tirzepatide) for chronic weight management in adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²) or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m²) with at least one weight-related condition such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, or cardiovascular disease. ZEPBOUND is the same molecule as MOUNJARO, which was approved for type 2 diabetes in May 2022.

## Mechanism of Action

Tirzepatide is a first-in-class dual GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist. This dual mechanism provides enhanced metabolic benefits:

**GIP Receptor Activation:**
- Enhances insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells
- Reduces food intake through central nervous system effects
- May improve lipid metabolism

**GLP-1 Receptor Activation:**
- Slows gastric emptying
- Reduces appetite and food intake
- Enhances satiety signaling
- Improves glycemic control

## Clinical Trial Data

### SURMOUNT-1 Trial

A Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 2,539 adults with obesity without diabetes.

**Weight Loss Results at 72 Weeks:**
- 5 mg dose: 15.0% mean weight loss vs 3.1% placebo
- 10 mg dose: 19.5% mean weight loss
- 15 mg dose: 20.9% mean weight loss

**Response Rates (≥5% weight loss):**
- 85% of patients on 5 mg achieved ≥5% weight loss
- 89% on 10 mg achieved ≥5% weight loss
- 91% on 15 mg achieved ≥5% weight loss

### SURMOUNT-2 Trial

Evaluated tirzepatide in 938 adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity.

**Results at 72 Weeks:**
- 10 mg: 12.8% mean weight loss
- 15 mg: 14.7% mean weight loss
- HbA1c reduction: 2.1% (10 mg) and 2.4% (15 mg)

### SURMOUNT-3 Trial

Intensive lifestyle intervention plus tirzepatide in 579 participants.

**Results:**
- Initial lifestyle intervention achieved 6.9% weight loss
- Addition of 15 mg tirzepatide achieved additional 18.4% weight loss (total 24.5%)

### SURMOUNT-4 Trial

Evaluated weight maintenance after initial weight loss with tirzepatide.

**Key Findings:**
- Patients switched to placebo regained 14% of initial weight
- Patients continuing tirzepatide maintained or lost additional weight
- Demonstrates importance of continued therapy

## Safety Profile

### Gastrointestinal Events

Most common adverse reactions (≥5%):
- Nausea: 29% (10 mg), 33% (15 mg) vs 6% placebo
- Diarrhea: 21% (10 mg), 23% (15 mg) vs 9% placebo
- Vomiting: 12% (10 mg), 16% (15 mg) vs 2% placebo
- Constipation: 11% (10 mg), 12% (15 mg) vs 5% placebo

GI events were generally mild to moderate and decreased over time.

### Serious Adverse Events

**Pancreatitis:**
- Acute pancreatitis reported in 0.2% of tirzepatide-treated patients
- Discontinue if pancreatitis suspected

**Gallbladder Events:**
- Cholelithiasis: 1.7% vs 0.5% placebo
- Cholecystitis: 0.7% vs 0.2% placebo
- Rapid weight loss may increase gallstone risk

### Boxed Warning: Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

Tirzepatide caused thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents. Clinical relevance unknown. Contraindicated in patients with personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).

## Dosing and Administration

ZEPBOUND is administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection.

**Dose Escalation Schedule:**
- Weeks 1-4: 2.5 mg weekly (initiation dose)
- Weeks 5-8: 5 mg weekly
- Weeks 9-12: 7.5 mg weekly (if needed)
- Weeks 13-16: 10 mg weekly (if needed)
- Week 17+: 12.5 mg or 15 mg weekly (maximum)

**Available Strengths:**
Single-dose pens: 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, 15 mg

## Supply and Access Issues

ZEPBOUND has experienced significant supply constraints since approval:
- High demand exceeded manufacturing capacity
- Eli Lilly increased production at Indianapolis facility
- Additional capacity coming online from Concord, NC plant
- Some dose strengths on FDA Drug Shortage List in early 2024

**List Price:** $1,059.87 for a 4-week supply
