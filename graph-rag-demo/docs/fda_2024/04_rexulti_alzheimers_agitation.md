# FDA Approval: REXULTI (brexpiprazole) for Alzheimer's Disease Agitation

**Approval Date:** May 11, 2023 (Expanded Indication)
**Application Number:** sNDA 205422
**Sponsor:** Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
**Partner:** Lundbeck
**Drug Class:** Atypical Antipsychotic (Dopamine D2/Serotonin 5-HT1A Partial Agonist)

## Summary of Approval

The FDA approved REXULTI (brexpiprazole) for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. This represents the first FDA-approved treatment specifically for this indication. REXULTI was previously approved in 2015 for schizophrenia and as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder.

## Clinical Significance

### Prevalence of Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease

Agitation is one of the most challenging behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's disease:
- Affects up to 70% of patients during disease course
- Major cause of caregiver burden and burnout
- Leading reason for nursing home placement
- Previously managed with off-label antipsychotics

### Prior Treatment Landscape

Before REXULTI approval:
- No FDA-approved medications for dementia-related agitation
- Off-label use of antipsychotics common (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine)
- Black box warning on all antipsychotics for increased mortality in elderly dementia patients
- Non-pharmacological interventions remain first-line

## Clinical Trial Data

### Phase 3 Program (Studies 331-12-283, 331-12-284, 331-14-213)

Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolled over 1,000 patients with Alzheimer's disease and clinically significant agitation.

**Study Population:**
- Diagnosis: Probable Alzheimer's disease (NIA-AA criteria)
- MMSE score: 5-22 (moderate to severe cognitive impairment)
- Clinically significant agitation: CMAI score ≥45
- Mean age: 74 years
- Setting: Nursing homes and assisted living facilities

### Efficacy Results

**Primary Endpoint: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) at Week 12**

| Study | REXULTI Change | Placebo Change | Difference | p-value |
|-------|----------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| 331-12-283 | -22.6 | -17.3 | -5.3 | p=0.0026 |
| 331-14-213 | -19.7 | -14.8 | -4.9 | p=0.0078 |

**Secondary Endpoints:**
- CGI-S (Clinical Global Impression-Severity): Significant improvement
- NPI-NH Agitation/Aggression domain: Significant improvement
- Onset of action: Improvements observed by Week 6

### Subgroup Analyses

Efficacy was consistent across:
- Age groups (65-74, 75-84, ≥85 years)
- Disease severity (mild, moderate, severe dementia)
- Baseline agitation severity
- Concomitant cholinesterase inhibitor use

## Safety Profile

### Black Box Warning

REXULTI carries a boxed warning regarding increased risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials of atypical antipsychotics in elderly dementia patients, mortality was approximately 4.5% vs 2.6% for placebo.

### Common Adverse Reactions

**Adverse events ≥2% and greater than placebo:**
- Headache: 5% vs 4% placebo
- Dizziness: 4% vs 3% placebo
- Urinary tract infection: 4% vs 3% placebo
- Nasopharyngitis: 3% vs 2% placebo
- Sleep disorder: 3% vs 1% placebo

### Metabolic Effects

- Weight gain: Mean increase 0.7 kg vs 0.2 kg placebo
- Glucose changes: Minimal differences from placebo
- Lipid changes: No clinically significant differences

### Cerebrovascular Adverse Events

- Incidence similar to placebo in clinical trials
- Monitoring recommended in patients with cerebrovascular risk factors

## Dosing and Administration

**Target Dose:** 2-3 mg once daily

**Titration Schedule:**
- Days 1-7: 0.5 mg once daily
- Days 8-14: 1 mg once daily
- Days 15-21: 2 mg once daily
- Day 22+: May increase to 3 mg if needed

**Special Populations:**
- Hepatic impairment (moderate): Max 2 mg daily
- Renal impairment (severe): Max 2 mg daily
- CYP2D6 poor metabolizers: Max 2 mg daily
- Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Half the usual dose

## Comparison with Off-Label Antipsychotics

| Drug | FDA Approved | CMAI Improvement | Notable Risks |
|------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| REXULTI | Yes (AD agitation) | -5.3 vs placebo | Mortality warning |
| Risperidone | No | -4.5 vs placebo | EPS, stroke |
| Olanzapine | No | -3.7 vs placebo | Metabolic syndrome |
| Quetiapine | No | Inconsistent | Sedation |

## Prescribing Considerations

### Patient Selection

Appropriate candidates:
- Confirmed Alzheimer's disease diagnosis
- Moderate to severe agitation affecting quality of life
- Failed non-pharmacological interventions
- No contraindications to antipsychotics
- Life expectancy considerations discussed with family

### Monitoring Requirements

- Metabolic parameters at baseline and periodically
- Signs of stroke or TIA
- Extrapyramidal symptoms
- Treatment response assessment (recommend CMAI)
- Periodic reassessment of continued need

## Partnership Details

REXULTI is jointly marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical and Lundbeck:
- Otsuka: Developed and owns the molecule
- Lundbeck: US marketing partner since 2014
- Both companies collaborate on Alzheimer's disease development programs
