# FDA Approval: ZYNYZ (retifanlimab-dlwr) for Merkel Cell Carcinoma

**Approval Date:** March 22, 2023
**Application Number:** BLA 761334
**Sponsor:** Incyte Corporation
**Drug Class:** PD-1 Blocking Antibody

## Overview

ZYNYZ is a PD-1 inhibitor approved for the treatment of adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). It is the third PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor approved for MCC, joining KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) and BAVENCIO (avelumab).

## Merkel Cell Carcinoma Background

### Disease Characteristics

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive skin cancer:
- Incidence: ~3,000 cases/year in US
- Median age at diagnosis: 75-80 years
- Risk factors: UV exposure, immunosuppression, Merkel cell polyomavirus
- 5-year survival (metastatic): ~14%
- Highly immunogenic tumor

### Role of Merkel Cell Polyomavirus

~80% of MCC tumors are associated with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV):
- Viral oncoproteins (LT, sT) drive tumorigenesis
- MCPyV-positive tumors: More immunogenic, better prognosis
- MCPyV-negative tumors: Associated with UV damage, more mutations
- Both subtypes respond to checkpoint inhibitors

## Clinical Trial Data

### POD1UM-201 Study

Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study in metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC.

**Population:**
- 65 patients enrolled
- Treatment-naive for metastatic/advanced disease
- ECOG performance status: 0-1
- Median age: 72 years

**Efficacy Results:**

| Endpoint | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Objective Response Rate | 52% (95% CI: 40-65%) |
| Complete Response | 18% |
| Partial Response | 34% |
| Disease Control Rate | 74% |
| Median Duration of Response | Not reached |
| DOR ≥6 months | 77% of responders |
| Median PFS | 10.1 months |

### Response by Subgroup

| Subgroup | ORR |
|----------|-----|
| MCPyV-positive | 61% |
| MCPyV-negative | 35% |
| PD-L1 ≥1% | 60% |
| PD-L1 <1% | 40% |

### Comparison with Other PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors in MCC

| Drug | Trial | Line | ORR | CR Rate |
|------|-------|------|-----|---------|
| ZYNYZ | POD1UM-201 | 1L | 52% | 18% |
| KEYTRUDA | KEYNOTE-017 | 1L | 56% | 24% |
| BAVENCIO | JAVELIN | 2L | 33% | 11% |

## Safety Profile

### Immune-Related Adverse Events

PD-1 inhibitors can cause immune-mediated toxicities:

**Observed in POD1UM-201:**
- Hypothyroidism: 12%
- Pneumonitis: 6%
- Hepatitis: 5%
- Colitis: 3%
- Adrenal insufficiency: 2%

**Management:**
- Early detection through monitoring
- Corticosteroids for most irAEs
- Hormone replacement for endocrinopathies
- Withhold or discontinue based on severity

### Most Common Adverse Events (≥20%)

- Fatigue: 31%
- Musculoskeletal pain: 25%
- Constipation: 23%
- Nausea: 22%
- Pruritus: 20%

### Infusion Reactions

- Any grade: 12%
- Grade 3+: 0%
- Manageable with standard premedication

## Dosing and Administration

**Dose:** 500 mg IV infusion every 4 weeks

**Duration:** Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

**Administration:**
- Infuse over 30 minutes
- No premedication required routinely
- Standard infusion reaction precautions

**Dose Modifications:**
- No dose reductions
- Withhold for Grade 2-3 immune-related AEs
- Permanently discontinue for Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3

## Competitive Positioning

### MCC Treatment Landscape

| Drug | Manufacturer | Dosing | FDA Approval |
|------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| BAVENCIO | EMD Serono/Pfizer | 800 mg Q2W | 2017 (MCC) |
| KEYTRUDA | Merck | 200 mg Q3W or 400 mg Q6W | 2018 (MCC) |
| ZYNYZ | Incyte | 500 mg Q4W | 2023 (MCC) |

### ZYNYZ Differentiators

**Advantages:**
- Convenient Q4W dosing (vs Q2W or Q3W)
- Fixed dosing (no weight-based calculation)
- Comparable efficacy to competitors

**Considerations:**
- Later market entry
- Less real-world data
- Limited awareness
