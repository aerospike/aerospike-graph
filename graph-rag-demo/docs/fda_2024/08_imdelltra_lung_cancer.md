# FDA Approval: IMDELLTRA (tarlatamab-dlle) for Small Cell Lung Cancer

**Approval Date:** May 16, 2024
**Application Number:** BLA 761341
**Sponsor:** Amgen Inc.
**Drug Class:** Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE) Antibody

## Overview

IMDELLTRA is the first bispecific T-cell engager approved for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). It targets DLL3 (delta-like ligand 3) on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells, bringing immune cells in close proximity to cancer cells to facilitate tumor destruction.

## Indication

IMDELLTRA is approved for the treatment of adult patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. This represents a major advance for a disease with historically limited treatment options after first-line therapy.

## Small Cell Lung Cancer Background

### Disease Characteristics

SCLC is an aggressive neuroendocrine cancer:
- Represents ~15% of all lung cancers
- 70% present with extensive stage disease
- Rapid doubling time and early metastasis
- High initial response to chemotherapy
- Near-universal relapse within 6-12 months
- 5-year survival rate: <7%

### Prior Treatment Landscape

**Before IMDELLTRA:**
- First-line: Platinum/etoposide + PD-L1 inhibitor
- Second-line: Topotecan (limited efficacy, ORR ~17-24%)
- Third-line: Lurbinectedin (ORR ~35%)
- No targeted therapies available

## Mechanism of Action

### DLL3 as Target

DLL3 is an ideal SCLC target:
- Expressed on >80% of SCLC tumors
- Minimal expression on normal tissues
- Cell surface expression in SCLC
- Inhibitory Notch ligand family member

### BiTE Technology

IMDELLTRA is a bispecific molecule that:
1. Binds DLL3 on SCLC cells with one arm
2. Binds CD3 on T cells with other arm
3. Creates immunological synapse
4. Activates T cells to kill tumor cells
5. Induces cytokine release and T cell proliferation

**Half-Molecule Exchange:**
IMDELLTRA uses Amgen's proprietary half-life extended BiTE platform:
- Extended half-life allowing IV dosing every 2 weeks
- Improved pharmacokinetics vs earlier BiTEs
- Reduced immunogenicity

## Clinical Trial Data

### DeLLphi-301 Study

Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study in previously treated ES-SCLC.

**Population:**
- 220 patients enrolled in primary efficacy population
- Median prior therapies: 2 (range 1-5)
- 69% had progressive disease on most recent therapy
- ECOG performance status: 0-1

**Efficacy Results:**

| Endpoint | 10 mg Cohort (n=88) |
|----------|---------------------|
| Objective Response Rate | 40% (95% CI: 30-51%) |
| Complete Response | 3.4% |
| Partial Response | 36.4% |
| Disease Control Rate | 70% |
| Median Duration of Response | 9.7 months |
| Median PFS | 4.9 months |
| Median OS | 14.3 months |

### Response by Subgroup

| Subgroup | ORR |
|----------|-----|
| Platinum-sensitive (≥90 days) | 52% |
| Platinum-resistant (<90 days) | 32% |
| Prior immunotherapy | 39% |
| 2 prior lines | 43% |
| 3+ prior lines | 36% |

### Comparator Context

Historical topotecan response rates: 17-24%
IMDELLTRA provides meaningful improvement over available options.

## Safety Profile

### Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)

Most significant risk requiring specialized management:

**Incidence:**
- Any grade: 51%
- Grade 3: 1%
- No Grade 4-5 events

**Timing:**
- Typically occurs with initial doses
- Most common: Days 1-3 after first infusion
- Decreases with subsequent doses

**Management:**
- Step-up dosing strategy required
- Hospitalization for first three doses recommended
- Tocilizumab and corticosteroids for treatment
- Dexamethasone premedication required

### Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity (ICANS)

**Incidence:**
- Any grade: 18%
- Grade 3+: 3%

**Symptoms:**
- Headache, confusion, tremor
- Encephalopathy, aphasia
- Usually concurrent with CRS

**Management:**
- Supportive care
- Corticosteroids for severe cases
- Monitor for 24 hours after step-up doses

### Other Adverse Events

**Common (≥20%):**
- Fatigue: 47%
- Pyrexia: 35%
- Decreased appetite: 28%
- Constipation: 27%
- Anemia: 26%
- Nausea: 22%

## Dosing and Administration

### Step-Up Dosing Protocol

Critical for managing CRS risk:

| Week | Day | Dose | Setting |
|------|-----|------|---------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 mg IV | Hospital |
| 1 | 4 | 10 mg IV | Hospital |
| 2 | 1 | 10 mg IV | Hospital (24h obs) |
| 3+ | Q2W | 10 mg IV | Outpatient possible |

### Pre-Medication

Required before each dose:
- Dexamethasone 8 mg IV (or equivalent)
- Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IV
- Acetaminophen 650-1000 mg PO

### REMS Program

IMDELLTRA has a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS):
- Healthcare setting must be enrolled
- Staff training on CRS/ICANS management
- Patient counseling requirements
- Tocilizumab must be available on-site

## Competitive Landscape

### Other DLL3-Targeting Agents

| Agent | Company | Modality | Status |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| IMDELLTRA | Amgen | BiTE | Approved |
| Rovalpituzumab tesirine | AbbVie | ADC | Discontinued (toxicity) |
| SC-002 | AbbVie | ADC | Phase 1 |
| AMG 757 (tarlatamab SC) | Amgen | BiTE (SC) | Phase 3 |

### Combination Studies

Amgen is investigating IMDELLTRA in combinations:
- With PD-L1 inhibitors (first-line)
- With chemotherapy
- With other immunotherapies
