# FDA Approval: CASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel) - First CRISPR Gene Therapy

**Approval Date:** December 8, 2023
**Application Number:** BLA 125747
**Sponsor:** Vertex Pharmaceuticals (in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics)
**Drug Class:** CRISPR/Cas9 Gene-Edited Cell Therapy

## Historic Significance

CASGEVY represents the first FDA-approved treatment utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. Approved on the same day as LYFGENIA (another gene therapy for sickle cell disease), CASGEVY marks a new era in genetic medicine.

## Indication

CASGEVY is approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) in patients 12 years and older with recurrent vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). It offers a potentially curative one-time treatment for a disease that has historically had limited treatment options.

## Mechanism of Action

### CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing

CASGEVY uses CRISPR technology to edit the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells:

**Target:** BCL11A gene enhancer region in erythroid cells

**Mechanism:**
1. Patient's hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) collected via apheresis
2. CRISPR/Cas9 creates targeted double-strand break in BCL11A enhancer
3. Disruption of BCL11A allows reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production
4. Edited cells infused back into patient after myeloablative conditioning
5. HbF compensates for defective adult hemoglobin (HbS)

### Why Fetal Hemoglobin?

- HbF doesn't polymerize like HbS under low oxygen conditions
- Naturally present at birth, then suppressed in infancy
- Hereditary persistence of HbF (HPFH) protects against SCD symptoms
- CASGEVY mimics HPFH by blocking BCL11A suppression of HbF

## Clinical Trial Data

### Study 121 (Primary Trial)

Open-label, single-arm study in patients with severe sickle cell disease.

**Enrollment:**
- 44 patients treated at data cutoff
- Age range: 12-35 years
- All had ≥2 VOCs in prior 2 years

**Efficacy Results:**

| Endpoint | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Primary: Freedom from VOCs for ≥12 months | 29/31 (93.5%) |
| VOC-free duration | Median not reached |
| Mean total hemoglobin | Increased from 9.5 to 12.0 g/dL |
| Mean HbF | Increased from 5.6% to 42.7% |
| Hospitalization rate | Decreased by 91% |

**Durability:**
- Longest follow-up: >3 years
- Benefits sustained in all responding patients
- No patient has lost response to date

### Real-World Considerations

**Treatment Process:**
1. Eligibility assessment and counseling: 2-4 weeks
2. Stem cell mobilization and collection: 2-3 weeks
3. Manufacturing of CASGEVY: 4-6 months
4. Myeloablative conditioning (busulfan): 4-5 days
5. CASGEVY infusion: Day 0
6. Engraftment period: 4-6 weeks
7. Recovery and monitoring: 3-6 months

**Total treatment journey: 12-18 months from start to recovery**

## Safety Profile

### Myeloablative Conditioning-Related Events

All patients received busulfan myeloablation before CASGEVY infusion:
- Mucositis: 62%
- Febrile neutropenia: 50%
- Nausea/vomiting: 80%
- Hepatic VOD: 7% (manageable)

### CASGEVY-Specific Adverse Events

**Hematologic:**
- Neutropenia (expected during engraftment)
- Thrombocytopenia (expected during engraftment)
- Median time to neutrophil engraftment: 42 days
- Median time to platelet engraftment: 50 days

**Other Concerns:**
- Off-target editing: Extensively analyzed, no concerning findings
- Secondary malignancy: None observed (ongoing monitoring)
- Graft failure: None in trials

### Boxed Warning

No boxed warning, but important safety considerations include:
- Risk of delayed platelet engraftment (monitoring required)
- Infertility from myeloablative conditioning (fertility preservation discussed)
- Risk of serious infections during aplastic period

## Comparison with LYFGENIA

Both approved December 8, 2023 for sickle cell disease:

| Feature | CASGEVY | LYFGENIA |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Technology | CRISPR/Cas9 | Lentiviral gene addition |
| Manufacturer | Vertex/CRISPR Therapeutics | bluebird bio |
| Mechanism | BCL11A disruption → HbF | Add anti-sickling gene |
| VOC-free rate | 93.5% | 88% |
| Engraftment time | ~42 days | ~20 days |
| Malignancy warning | No | Yes (boxed warning) |
| List price | $2.2 million | $3.1 million |

## Access and Cost

### Pricing

- **List Price:** $2.2 million (one-time)
- Vertex offers outcomes-based agreements with payers
- Lifetime SCD treatment costs estimated at $1.6-6 million

### Certified Treatment Centers

CASGEVY is only available at certified treatment centers with:
- Experience in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
- Capability for extended inpatient care
- Access to blood bank services
- Expertise in sickle cell disease management

**Initial certified centers:** ~50 in the US

### Insurance Coverage

- Most commercial insurers covering case-by-case
- Medicaid coverage varies by state
- Medicare coverage for eligible patients
- Significant prior authorization requirements

## Future Development

Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics are exploring:

**CASGEVY in Beta-Thalassemia:**
- Already approved for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia
- Similar mechanism (HbF induction)

**Next-Generation Approaches:**
- In vivo gene editing (no need for cell harvesting)
- Non-myeloablative conditioning regimens
- Combination therapies

**Related Pipeline:**
- CTX110: Allogeneic CAR-T (off-the-shelf)
- CTX130: Gene-edited CAR-T for solid tumors
- CTX310: In vivo gene editing for ATTR

Dr. Nicole Verdun of FDA's CBER stated: "Gene therapy holds the promise of delivering more targeted treatments. These approvals represent an important advancement in sickle cell disease treatment."
