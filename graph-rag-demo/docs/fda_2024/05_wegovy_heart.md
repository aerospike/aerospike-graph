# FDA Approval: WEGOVY (semaglutide) Cardiovascular Risk Reduction

**Expanded Indication Date:** March 8, 2024
**Original Approval:** June 4, 2021 (Weight Management)
**Application Number:** BLA 215256
**Sponsor:** Novo Nordisk A/S
**Drug Class:** GLP-1 Receptor Agonist

## Summary of Expanded Indication

The FDA approved WEGOVY (semaglutide 2.4 mg) to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, or non-fatal stroke) in adults with established cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight. This makes WEGOVY the first weight loss medication approved to prevent life-threatening cardiovascular events.

## Clinical Trial: SELECT Study

### Study Design

SELECT (Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People with Overweight or Obesity) was a landmark cardiovascular outcomes trial:

**Population:**
- 17,604 participants randomized
- Adults ≥45 years of age
- BMI ≥27 kg/m² (no upper limit)
- Established cardiovascular disease (prior MI, stroke, or PAD)
- No history of diabetes (excluded type 2 diabetes)

**Study Duration:**
- Mean follow-up: 39.8 months (3.3 years)
- Maximum follow-up: 5 years
- Conducted at 804 sites in 41 countries

### Primary Endpoint Results

**3-Point MACE (cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke):**
- WEGOVY: 6.5% experienced MACE
- Placebo: 8.0% experienced MACE
- Hazard Ratio: 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72-0.90)
- Relative Risk Reduction: 20%
- Absolute Risk Reduction: 1.5%
- Number Needed to Treat (NNT): 67 over ~3.3 years

### Component Analysis

| Outcome | WEGOVY | Placebo | HR (95% CI) |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| CV death | 2.5% | 3.0% | 0.85 (0.71-1.01) |
| Non-fatal MI | 2.7% | 3.3% | 0.82 (0.68-0.98) |
| Non-fatal stroke | 1.7% | 2.1% | 0.79 (0.62-0.99) |
| All-cause mortality | 4.3% | 4.9% | 0.81 (0.71-0.93) |

### Secondary Outcomes

**Heart Failure:**
- Hospitalization for HF: HR 0.82 (0.71-0.96)
- Composite HF endpoint: Significant reduction

**Weight Loss:**
- Mean weight loss at week 104: 9.4% vs 0.9% placebo
- Weight loss sustained throughout study

**Metabolic Parameters:**
- HbA1c: -0.31% reduction vs placebo
- Blood pressure: -3.2/-1.6 mmHg reduction
- Lipids: Improvements in triglycerides and LDL

## Mechanism of Cardiovascular Benefit

The cardiovascular benefits appear multifactorial:

**Direct Effects:**
- Anti-inflammatory actions (reduced CRP, IL-6)
- Improved endothelial function
- Reduced arterial stiffness
- Possible direct cardiac effects

**Indirect Effects (via weight loss):**
- Improved glycemic control
- Blood pressure reduction
- Lipid improvements
- Reduced visceral adiposity

## Safety in SELECT Trial

### Adverse Events

**Gastrointestinal (most common):**
- Nausea: 45% vs 26% placebo (at any time)
- Diarrhea: 34% vs 21% placebo
- Vomiting: 24% vs 10% placebo
- Constipation: 24% vs 12% placebo
- Events decreased over time with continued use

**Serious Adverse Events:**
- Overall SAE rate: 33.4% WEGOVY vs 36.4% placebo
- Lower rate in WEGOVY group

### Gallbladder Events

- Cholelithiasis: 2.6% vs 1.9% placebo
- Cholecystitis: 0.8% vs 0.4% placebo

### Pancreatitis

- Acute pancreatitis: 0.2% vs 0.1% placebo
- Discontinue if pancreatitis suspected

### Discontinuation Rates

- WEGOVY: 16.6% discontinued due to adverse events
- Placebo: 8.2% discontinued
- Most discontinuations due to GI events

## Comparison with Other GLP-1 Agonists

### Cardiovascular Outcomes Trials

| Drug | Trial | Population | MACE Reduction |
|------|-------|------------|----------------|
| WEGOVY (semaglutide 2.4 mg) | SELECT | Obesity + CVD | 20% |
| Ozempic (semaglutide 1.0 mg) | SUSTAIN-6 | T2DM + CVD | 26% |
| Victoza (liraglutide) | LEADER | T2DM + CVD | 13% |
| Trulicity (dulaglutide) | REWIND | T2DM | 12% |

### Comparison with ZEPBOUND (tirzepatide)

| Feature | WEGOVY | ZEPBOUND |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Mechanism | GLP-1 | GIP/GLP-1 |
| CV outcomes data | Yes (SELECT) | Pending (SURPASS-CVOT) |
| Mean weight loss | ~15% | ~21% |
| FDA approved for CV risk | Yes | No (pending) |

## Clinical Implementation

### Prescribing for CV Risk Reduction

**Eligible Patients:**
- BMI ≥27 kg/m²
- Established CVD (prior MI, stroke, PAD)
- With or without type 2 diabetes

**Dosing:**
Same as weight management indication:
- Start 0.25 mg weekly, escalate monthly
- Target dose: 2.4 mg weekly

### Insurance and Access

**Medicare:**
- Previously not covered for obesity alone
- Now covered for CV risk reduction indication
- Part D benefit

**Commercial Insurance:**
- Most now covering for CV indication
- May still have PA requirements
- Step therapy may be required

The GLP-1 family from Novo Nordisk:
- **OZEMPIC** (semaglutide 0.5-2 mg) - Type 2 diabetes
- **RYBELSUS** (oral semaglutide) - Type 2 diabetes

Dr. John Sharretts of FDA's Division of Diabetes commented: "Wegovy is now the first weight loss medication to also be approved to help prevent serious heart problems in adults with cardiovascular disease who also have obesity or overweight."
