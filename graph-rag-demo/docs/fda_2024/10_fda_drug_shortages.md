# FDA Report: Critical Drug Shortages in 2024

**Report Date:** Q3 2024
**Source:** FDA Drug Shortage Database
**Compiled by:** Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)

## Executive Summary

The FDA continues to monitor and address drug shortages affecting patient care. As of Q3 2024, several critical medications face supply constraints, including newly approved therapies like GLP-1 agonists and established essential medicines. This report summarizes current shortages, their causes, and mitigation efforts.

## GLP-1 Agonist Shortage Crisis

### Affected Products

The unprecedented demand for weight loss and diabetes medications has created sustained shortages:

**ZEPBOUND (tirzepatide) - Eli Lilly:**
- All dose strengths on shortage list since Q1 2024
- 2.5 mg and 5 mg most affected (starter doses)
- Manufacturing expansion underway
- Indianapolis facility increased capacity 50%
- Concord, NC facility coming online 2025

**WEGOVY (semaglutide 2.4 mg) - Novo Nordisk:**
- Intermittent shortages since launch
- 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg starter doses affected
- Novo Nordisk limiting new patient starts periodically
- Clayton, NC facility expansion completed

**MOUNJARO (tirzepatide) - Eli Lilly:**
- Same molecule as ZEPBOUND
- Supply prioritized for diabetes indication
- Similar shortage patterns

**OZEMPIC (semaglutide) - Novo Nordisk:**
- Periodic shortages of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg pens
- 1 mg and 2 mg less affected
- Off-label weight loss use contributing to shortage

### FDA Response

FDA has taken multiple actions:
1. Import permissions for international supplies
2. Expedited manufacturing inspections
3. Flexibility on lot release testing
4. Public communication campaigns on compounding risks

### Compounding Concerns

FDA has issued warnings about compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide:
- Salt forms (sodium, acetate) not equivalent to approved products
- Compounding pharmacies under increased scrutiny
- Multiple adverse event reports from compounded products
- Reminder that these are not FDA-approved alternatives

## Oncology Drug Shortages

### Chemotherapy Agents

Several essential chemotherapy drugs remain in shortage:

**Carboplatin:**
- Multi-source generic, multiple manufacturers
- Caused by manufacturing quality issues
- Pfizer, Teva, others affected
- Approximately 60% of normal supply available

**Cisplatin:**
- Similar causes as carboplatin
- Substitutions limited due to different toxicity profiles
- FDA working with manufacturers on capacity expansion

**Methotrexate (injection):**
- Shortages affecting high-dose protocols
- Pediatric oncology particularly impacted
- Oral formulation generally available

### Supportive Care Medications

**Ondansetron (IV):**
- Antiemetic critical for chemotherapy
- Periodic shortages from manufacturing issues
- Oral formulation available as alternative

## Alzheimer's Disease Treatments

### Anti-Amyloid Antibodies

Despite controlled distribution, supply challenges exist:

**LEQEMBI (lecanemab) - Eisai/Biogen:**
- Limited infusion center capacity (not manufacturing)
- MRI monitoring capacity constraints
- Specialized storage requirements
- New subcutaneous formulation may ease access

**KISUNLA (donanemab) - Eli Lilly:**
- Just approved July 2024
- Launch supply adequate
- Monitoring for demand surge
- Indianapolis manufacturing hub

### REXULTI (brexpiprazole) - Otsuka/Lundbeck

- Temporary shortage after AD agitation approval
- Demand exceeded forecasts
- Supply normalized by Q3 2024
- Manufacturing increased at Japan facility

## Shortage Causes Analysis

### Manufacturing Quality Issues

Top contributor to shortages in 2024:
- FDA Form 483 observations increasing
- Data integrity concerns
- Sterility assurance failures
- Aging manufacturing infrastructure

### Demand Surge

Particularly affecting newer therapies:
- GLP-1 agonists for weight loss
- Gene therapies (manufacturing complexity)
- CAR-T therapies (personalized manufacturing)

### Economic Factors

- Low-margin generics less attractive to manufacture
- Single-source drugs vulnerable
- Price controls limiting investment incentives

### Supply Chain

- Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) concentration overseas
- Logistics disruptions
- Container shortages post-pandemic

## Mitigation Strategies

### FDA Tools and Authorities

**Drug Shortage Staff Activities:**
- Monitor all reported shortages
- Work with manufacturers to prevent shortages
- Identify therapeutic alternatives
- Expedite inspections and reviews

**Regulatory Flexibility:**
- Extended expiration dating when data supports
- Alternative supplier approvals
- Import of unapproved versions in emergencies

### Manufacturer Responsibilities

Companies are required to:
- Notify FDA 6 months before discontinuation
- Report meaningful supply disruptions
- Maintain contingency plans
- Consider FDA requests to continue production

## Impact on Newly Approved Drugs

### Launch Supply Challenges

Several 2023-2024 approvals faced launch constraints:

| Drug | Manufacturer | Issue | Resolution |
|------|--------------|-------|------------|
| ZEPBOUND | Eli Lilly | Overwhelming demand | Capacity expansion |
| KISUNLA | Eli Lilly | Controlled launch | Gradual ramp-up |
| CASGEVY | Vertex | Limited centers | Center expansion |
| LYFGENIA | bluebird bio | Manufacturing complexity | Case-by-case |
| IMDELLTRA | Amgen | REMS requirements | Training rollout |

### Gene Therapy Manufacturing

Unique challenges for cell and gene therapies:
- Patient-specific manufacturing
- 4-6 month production timelines
- Specialized facilities required
- Limited manufacturing slots

**CASGEVY and LYFGENIA:**
- Manufacturing capacity limits patient access
- ~200-300 patients/year initially
- Expansion plans underway
- Vertex building new facility

## Recommendations

### For Healthcare Providers

1. Check FDA shortage list regularly
2. Plan for alternatives when available
3. Report shortages to FDA MedWatch
4. Avoid stockpiling (worsens shortages)

### For Patients

1. Maintain communication with healthcare team
2. Don't skip doses without consultation
3. Report access issues to FDA
4. Be cautious of unverified sources

### For Manufacturers

1. Invest in manufacturing resilience
2. Diversify API sources
3. Maintain safety stock
4. Proactive FDA communication
